# Drone Data Transmission & Multi-ROI Detection Client

---
## Repository Overview
- This client application collects telemetry data from a drone and transmits it to a central server in real time.
- The system is designed to operate in an environment where the drone’s video feed and on-screen telemetry data can be continuously monitored.
- Typically, telemetry information is captured directly from the drone controller’s display, where speed and other flight data are shown.

## How It Works

### SETUP
| 1. CONNECT TO THE SERVER | 2. SELECT ROI | 3. ANALYSIS |

|Enter the authorized drone serial and device name, then connect.|Select the regions on the screen to monitor the desired information.|When data is detected, it is processed and sent to the main server.|

### SEND DATA
| DETECT HUMAN | SEND EVENT DATA |

## Event Handling
When a human is detected in the video feed, an event is generated.
The event data is transmitted to the server.
Both the server and the client can monitor these events in real time.

## Caution
The system must operate in an environment where the drone’s video information can be monitored in real time.
Drone telemetry data is typically obtained from the camera drone’s remote controller screen.
The screen must display speed and other flight information.
For coordinate detection, a simple GPS module should be attached, and its data must be visible on the screen so it can be detected in real time.
